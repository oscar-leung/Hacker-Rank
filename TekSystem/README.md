_Simply converting strings to numbers and adding them together isn’t acceptable._
The best guidance I can offer is that the candidate should be able to solve Leetcode medium level questions. What we are looking for in the interview:
• Be able to come up with an efficient algorithm (in terms of space and time complexity)
• Be able to write working code
• Be able to identify different test scenarios including edge cases
• Be able to test, debug and fix their code
Be sure to touch on these when solving for the solution:
• Pad the right side
• Pad the left side
• Make sure string is same length by putting 0’s where it was missing (be careful w/ decimal points)
• Make sure to remove trailing 0’s
• Chunk out each step into it’s own function _NOT REQUIRED BUT CODE LOOKS CLEANER DOING SO_
Be sure to keep solution concise do not over engineer.
